# TimeComplexity
It's a simple student project for data structures. feel free to point out the problems :)
I've put the whole python file in main folder but if you want to use these algorithms separatly you can see the "Source" folder.
so, these python files are so simple just run it and it will show you the diagram (created with matplotlib).
and for the all-algorithms py file it just works with a simple menu.
hope these codes are usefull for you.
