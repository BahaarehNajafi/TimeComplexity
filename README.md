# TimeComplexity
It's a simple student project for data structures. feel free to point out the problems :)
I've put the whole python file in main folder but if you want to use these algorithms separatly you can see the "Source" folder.
These python files are so simple just run it and it will show you the diagram of the time algorithm (created with matplotlib) takes to execute on different sizes of lists. 
and for the all-algorithms py file it just works with a simple menu.
this code works better with big lists, but in case your RAM storage is not that big and it takes a long time to run the code, you can simply change the random list's lenght by changing the variable 'n'.
hope these codes are usefull for you.
